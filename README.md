## Description
### Twitter allows businesses to engage personally with their customers, but there is so much data on Twitter that it is hard for brands to sort through each tweet to see what mentions could harm their business. This is where sentiment analysis comes into play. Sentiment analysis is a tool that allows us to automatically monitor emotions on social media platforms and is an important instrument in social media marketing strategies. We hope that our final product will be able to take a tweet as an input and classify the tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral and also be able to state how confident the model is for the classification.

## Final Note
### Feel free to ask us any questions or bring up an issue.
